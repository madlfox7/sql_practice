 Steps to Drop a Database in SQL Server
Switch to another database (master) – You cannot drop a database if you're currently using it.
Ensure there are no active connections – Force disconnect if necessary.
Drop the database using DROP DATABASE.

USE master;
GO

-- Set database to SINGLE_USER mode to disconnect all users
ALTER DATABASE edu SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
GO

-- Drop the database
DROP DATABASE edu;
GO

USE master; → Switches to the master database to prevent using edu.
ALTER DATABASE edu SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
Forces all connections to close.
Rolls back any open transactions.
DROP DATABASE edu;


Common Errors & Fixes
Error Message	Cause	Solution
Cannot drop database because it is currently in use.	Active connections exist.	Use ALTER DATABASE edu SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
Cannot drop database because there are open transactions.	Uncommitted transactions.	Force rollback with WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE.
Cannot drop database because it does not exist.	Database was already removed or misspelled.	Use IF DB_ID('edu') IS NOT NULL before dropping.

Dropping a database permanently deletes all data inside it.
Ensure you back up important data before running DROP DATABASE.
You cannot rollback a dropped database unless you have a backup.

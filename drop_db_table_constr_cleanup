 Steps to Drop a Database in SQL Server
Switch to another database (master) – You cannot drop a database if you're currently using it.
Ensure there are no active connections – Force disconnect if necessary.
Drop the database using DROP DATABASE.

USE master;
GO

-- Set database to SINGLE_USER mode to disconnect all users
ALTER DATABASE edu SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
GO

-- Drop the database
DROP DATABASE edu;
GO

USE master; → Switches to the master database to prevent using edu.
ALTER DATABASE edu SET SINGLE_USER WITH ROLLBACK IMMEDIATE;
Forces all connections to close.
Rolls back any open transactions.
DROP DATABASE edu;
